# ML-models-comparative-study
 
This was my Machine Learning & Data Mining project for two case studies. The tasks were (a) to implement machine learning techniques and pipelines appropriate for a particular practical problem; and (b) to undertake a comparative evaluation of several machine learning procedures when applied to the specific problem.
